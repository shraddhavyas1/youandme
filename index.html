            <h1>YOU AND ME</h1>
            <p>At the beach, let my forehead find its calm,  
Place your hand in mine, let our hearts find ease.
Under the moon, let your whispers flow,  
With you beside me, all my troubles go.</p>

<p>On the first day I saw you, my heart lost its way,
On the second day, my soul couldn't stay.
But you don't know,
How many months have slipped away in just these two days,
If only you’d stay, together we could blaze </p>


<p>In just these days, how many months have passed?

By the river’s side, let’s build a sweet home,  
With a roof and lamp, so we’re never alone.  
Don’t turn away, let’s make dreams come true,  
All my hopes and dreams are wrapped around you.
